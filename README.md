# Demo
This branch (reactified branch) has a [demo](http://amigosalud.rebienestar.com/).

# Installation

```
npm install
```

- Run in development mode: `npm run start`. Note that the backend app needs to be running. Please visit [https://github.com/carlos-peru/gateway](https://github.com/carlos-peru/gateway) for details.
- Generate a build: `npm run build`

The app will run in [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

# Software Design

This is a single page application. The app was built in component blocks that put together, represent the UI.

# Setup

The app uses eslint and prettier to maintain a good quality of code. The app is powered by webpack to enable modules as well as babel for transpiling es6.

# Implementation

This branch has converted the app into a React app. It relies on webpack for builds and babel for transpiling. The main idea is to separate business logic from UI. Some components are coupled with some UI specific logic. Most of the business logic was implemented through services and utility modules.

# Tests

The tests suite has unit tests as well as end-to-end testing. The first one relies on Jest and the second one is powered by Cypress.

- Run the unit tests with: `npm run test`.
- Run the e2e tests with: `npm run cypress`. Note that the app needs to be running in order to successfully run the e2e test.

## More on e2e

When the e2e tests are run, videos are autogenerated in the `cypress/videos` directory.

It's possible to run the e2e tests through a visual interface using the following command:

```
npm run cypress:open
```

From the UI, you can click into the test and this will run on your browser.
